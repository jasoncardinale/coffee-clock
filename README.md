# coffee-clock

## Description
A 3D printed desktop alarm clock. Time can be adjusted and an alarm can be set by the user. If enabled, a predetermined number of seconds prior to the
alarm going off, water will be pulled from a reservoir, through a Brita filter, followed by a pump that pushes the filtered water over a mug where
it is dropped through a coffee filter. When the entirety of the water from the reservoir has been transported to the mug, a heater placed within the mug
will activate for a predetermined amount of time.

This was designed as a gift and is NYC themed. 

In the future I wish to incorporate water level sensors and thermometers so that both the completion of pumping process and heating can be carried out with
the intent of achieving a set of parameters as opposed to simply using a time estimate.
